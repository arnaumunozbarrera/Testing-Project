# MVC Example
This project demonstrates how to implement the Model View Controller pattern.

The MVC is is a software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components. 
The Model manages the data, logic, and business rules, while the View is responsible for presenting the data to the user in a clear and interactive way. 
The Controller acts as a bridge, handling user input and updating the Model and View accordingly. 
This separation allows for better maintainability and scalability, as changes to one component do not heavily impact others. 

MVC is widely used in web and software development to create modular, flexible, and reusable code.
